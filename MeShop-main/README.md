# About Meshop.
MeShop. is the dummy shopping website, which gives us the realistic feel of the online shopping done on the various online shopping platforms available in the market. It is not as sophisticated and efficient as other online shopping platforms are, but contains the required features such as product searching, filtering, cart feature, user login, use signup, user authentication and much more. It covers the complete cycle right from the start of product search to the dummy payment completion.
            
# Technologies used by MeShop.
<p>
              MeShop. is entirely designed and developed in HTML, CSS and
              Javascript. It do not implements any third party CSS or Javscript
              frameworks like Tailwind or ReactJS. We are using the dummy
              products, whose JSON file is fetched from the Fake Store API
              website. This JSON file is then rendered as the dummy products in
              the shop portal. As MeShop. is the dummy shopping platform, it is
              required for it to have the dummy payment portal. This
              functionality is adopted using the RazorPay API which allows us to
              make the dummy payments. The deployment part of the website is
              handled by the Github Pages and the code is deployed in the Github
              Repository.

            <p>
              The backbone of any shopping platform is its storage, as it is
              required to store the user details for authentication purpose,
              product details and many more. This part of backend is taken care
              by the browsers local storage. The local storage of the browser is
              used to store the user details such as email and password, current
              user details, product data that is fetched from the server and the
              cart details of the products that are added by the user.

                The cart page is specifically designed for the preview of the
                products that are added to the cart. Local storage acts as the
                exchange point between shopping portal and the cart page.
                Whenever the user adds or remove the product in shopping portal,
                this information is stored in local storage and then the
                information stored is access by the cart page to render the
                data.
